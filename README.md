# uOttawa Gym Tracker

The uOttawa squash courts have been closed since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Since the capacity of the uOttawa gym facilities have been reduced and there is a large demand for students wanting to workout the squash courts are being used as extra space to maximize the gym's capacity. Therefore squash will remain closed until the capacity restrictions are lifted or _someone_ gathers data about how quickly the gym is being booked up, if there are any less popular hours, etc.
